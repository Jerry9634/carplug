# 1. CarPlug Overview
Solution for implementing Tesla clone (Tesla-style Touchscreen UI)
- **Android**(not Android Automotive) and **React Native** for developing high-integrity UI

- **Node.js** signal server/gateway for interconnecting **Legacy CAN** Domains and IP-based **High-Performance Computers**


# 2. Target Audience
- OEM: trying to catch up with Tesla Touchscreen UI (Media Controller)
- Tier-1: offering advanced but universal/single/own-branded infotainment system to several global OEMs
- Google or Apple integrating vehicle interfaces to its mobile OS (Android or iOS)


# 3. Demo

# 4. Architecture: Building Blocks
![overall architecture](carplug_architecture.png)

## 1) dashboard (Tesla-style touchscreen UI, main HMI)
**Android**(not Android Automotive) and **React Native** based touchscreen infotainment UI

## 2) signal server
**Node.js** signal server/gateway for interconnecting **Legacy CAN** Domains and IP-based **High-Performance Computers**

## 3) phone app (TBD)

## 4) vehicle simulation (TBD)

## 5) dashboard desktop version (development purpose only)
For people who don't have any Android tablet.

## 6) signal viewer (development purpose only)
CAN signal viewer


# 5. Benefits
## 1) Why not Android Automotive but "pure" Android?
- Well-established mobile Apps can be reused without any change

  Third-party navigation and map: Google, Baidu, and Korean maps (Kakao, T-Map)

  Music streaming: Spotify, YouTube Music, ...

  OTT: Netflix, YouTube, ...
- ICT industry's tons of developers ready to join auto industry only if vehicle signals are visible to them. Where Signal Server/Gateway is needed.

  Are they willing to learn Android Automotive? Not very likely.
## 2) React Native
- Easy Javascript programming language
- Largest Javascript developer pool
- Huge "React Native" developer community
- Performance not lost by utilizing Native module programming if necessary
## 3) Node.js
- Several protocols processed by a single Node.js server: HTTP, WebSocket, UDP, WebRTC
- Thousands of CAN signals distributed efficiently to Apps residing on HPC and vice versa
- Set, Get, Subscribe/Unsubscribe supported
